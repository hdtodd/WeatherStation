# Testing WS

Create the WeatherStation executable (filename 'ws') by connecting to the '.../src' directory and issuing the command `make`.  Then issuing the command `./ws ?` generates the output 

	WeatherStation v5.3: program to collect and record meteorological data
	ws <mode> where <mode> = prt | sql | xml
	

So `./ws prt` collects data from the Arduino weather probe at regular intervals (compile-time parameter set at 300 seconds as distributed) and generates to the controlling terminal a nicely-formatted report of the data.  And `./ws prt > myreport.rpt` generates that report to the file myreport.rpt.

Similarly, `./ws xml` generates an xml-formatted report to the terminal, and `./ws xml > live-data.xml` generates that report to the file live-data.xml.  [This package includes xml tree-parsing routines that will display the xml data elements or convert the data to comma-separated-variable, csv, format.]

The command `./ws sql` differs in that it creates (if necessary) a MySQL table or sqlite3 file and table and appends the periodic data to that file.  By default, ws compiles to use sqlite3, and the database file is stored in /var/databases/weather_data.db.  If you intend to use MySQL to store the data, you must set the database username/password in the WS.h file prior to doing the `make` that creates ws.  If you intend to use sqlite3, you must have write privileges to /var/databases or you must run ws as root, as in `sudo ./ws sql`.

You can use ^C (CNTL-C) to stop execution of ws in test mode.  It halts execution as you would expect, except that in xml mode it issues the <\\samples> text that closes the xml file correctly.  As a result, that xml file can be fed directly into the xml parsing programs to validate or extract data.

#Testing WP

If you want to compile and upload the WP code into the Arduino without running WeatherStation:

* `cd WeatherStation/WP`
* `make`
* `make upload; minicom`

assuming that you're using `minicom` for communication between your host Pi and the probe.  

Once the code is uploaded and running, it will announce itself over the USB connection, inform you of any missing sensors, and then await commands over the USB port.  `?` or `help` will give a list of commands to try.  A simple example would be to type `report` and then `sample` to show you the date-time stamp and readings from any connected sensors.  

WP does not support editing of command lines typed, so you can't correct typing mistakes.  Just press RETURN and start a new command line.
